# twitter-sentiment-analysis



In this file, ID, information, review, sentiments of tweets are given. 
Sentiments are: positive, negative, irrelevant, neutral.
I have converted all the categorical values into labels and converted the reviews in the form of matrix for fitting it into the algorithms.
